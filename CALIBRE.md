How TO Publish in CALIBRE
-------------------------

Make the HTML into a zip file.

Drag the ZIP file into Calibre

Convert to EPUB - In the dialog that popps up
-  Set title and author
-  Set Cover
-  Do *not* do heuristic processing
-  Under Structure Detection, Blank out the Insert page breaks before regex

Use Calibre to do the MOBI conversion - just uploadig the EPUB seems
to lose KDP awareness of the table of contents.

Save To Disk in a Single Directory
